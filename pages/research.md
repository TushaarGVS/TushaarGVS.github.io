#### <u>Prescription Drug Coupons: A Way to Get Around the Tiered Tormulary</u>
*A relatively recent and increasingly used strategy by pharmaceutical companies to retain market share upon generic entry has been to offer copay coupons. These coupons are offers from the pharmaceutical company to pay a portion of a patient's out-of-pocket cost. The coupons allow pharmaceutical companies to bypass the tiered formulary set by the insurance company. Unsurprisingly, these coupons have been the subject of much debate, with various stakeholders making vastly different claims about the effects. Insurance companies and government at both the state and federal level claim the coupons increase costs by inducing people to purchase expensive brand-name drugs over less-costly generic alternatives. Pharmaceutical companies, as well as various patient advocacy groups, claim coupons decrease costs by increasing medication adherence and preventing avoidable hospitalizations. In this paper, I address this debate by using insurance claims from a large, national insurer to estimate the effect of coupons on generic drug use, medication adherence, and hospitalizations. I take advantage of variation in who is legally allowed to use coupons, as well as which drugs offer coupons, to estimate difference-in-difference models.*

#### <u> Hospital Awnership and Admission Through the Emergency Department </u>
*Using the universe of ER discharge records for multiple states and years, I determine whether hospital ownership affects hospital admission rates for patients who show up in
the emergency room. I use within-hospital variation from ownership conversions to estimate hospital fixed-effects regressions and event studies. The results indicate that
conversion to for-profit from nonprofit or government ownership results in a 2-3 percentage point increase in admission rates, with the effects concentrated to Medicare
and Medicaid patients. These results are consistent with whistleblower lawsuits which allege that for-profit hospitals admit patients through the ED when it is not medically
necessary.*

#### <u>Non-Monetary Obstacles to Medical Care: Evidence from Postpartum Contraceptives</u>
*Since 2012, state Medicaid agencies have begun to offer increased reimbursement for inpatient postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). The reimbursement
has come in the form of unbundling the device payment from the global hospital payment, i.e. reimbursing the hospital specifically for the insertion of LARC. We use variation across states and time in the implemtnation of the policy to determine how the increased payments affect LARC use, fertility, and adverse birth outcomes.* (with [Barton Willage](https://bjwillage.github.io/))
