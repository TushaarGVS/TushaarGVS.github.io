  <b>Mission.</b> My team and I at the Kindle Content Experience and Quality Algorithms org., Amazon.com, Inc., aim at ensuring <i>consistency</i> in the quality of production and publishing, while enhancing the reader experience (e.g., automated real-time text analysis, text tagging, automated formatting suggestions, etc.). Our main objective is to draw out a set of intelligent AI-assisted reader experience enhancement algorithms with "personalized" suggestions from the content quality perspective, in turn improving the volume of readers. Determining and devising robust, flexible, and scalable solutions to existing publishing problems. From the personalization perspective, it is important to draw behavioral patterns that are reader and publisher specific.<br/><br/>

  To expand on the way of personalization, we aim at extracting the crux of a book that is very specific to authors' writing styles &#151; readability, writing density, phonology, and lyricism, among many other qualities &#151; each forming a piece of the ATGC code of the book. Using the state-of-the-art language processing and machine learning solutions, we aim at mapping the authors' genetic code with the way readers experience the same. Based on the underlying analysis, one can then formulate intelligent informative recommendations, both to the reader and the publishers, concerning the expected quality of writing. Instilling such perspectives through intelligent systems can help us adapt to the dynamic nature of literary writing and facilitate deeply satisfying user experiences!

  <b>Bio.</b> Tushaar Gangavarapu is a Machine Learning Research Engineer at the <i>AQuA</i> &#151; <i>A</i>utomated <i>Qu</i>ality <i>A</i>ssistance team of Kindle Content Experience and Quality Algorithms org. at Amazon.com, Inc., India. He is an alumnus (undergraduate) of the <a href="https://infotech.nitk.ac.in/" target="_blank">Department of Information Technology</a> at <a href="http://www.nitk.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India.</a> During his undergraduate study, he focused on <i>cognitive psychology and learning sciences</i> involving gauging the human behavioral patterns and modeling personality traits, under the guidance of <a href="https://infotech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/ram-mohana-reddy-guddeti" target="_blank">Prof. Ram Mohana Reddy Guddeti</a>, in association with the <a href="http://hccg.nitk.ac.in/" target="_blank">Human Centered Computing Group (HCCG)</a>. He also worked on developing <i>deep neural architectures for intelligent healthcare applications</i>, with the <a href="https://halelabnitk.github.io/" target="_blank">Healthcare Analytics and Language Engineering (HALE) Lab</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://infotech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/sowmya-kamath-s" target="_blank">Dr. Sowmya Kamath</a>. <br/><br/>

  Over the course of his undergraduate study, he underwent two internships, one with Cultyvate at PES University, where he worked on developing effective <i>neural architectures to improve the crop yield based on weather conditions</i>. He also worked with the Kindle Create team at Amazon.com, Inc., where he modeled <i>deep language processing models for customer assistance</i> and also worked on providing <i>accessibility to the blind</i>. He has given expert talks and guest lectures on several topics, including the vitality of social media analytics for predictive applications, assessment of game-based outcomes, and greediness and selfishness of genetic selectors.
